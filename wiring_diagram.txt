ADS-B Flight Tracker Wiring Diagram
====================================

Arduino Mega 2560 Pin Connections:

POWER SUPPLY:
- Arduino VIN -> 5V Power Supply
- Arduino GND -> Power Supply GND

ADS-B RECEIVER MODULE:
- Arduino RX1 (Pin 19) <- ADS-B Receiver TX
- Arduino GND <- ADS-B Receiver GND
- Arduino 5V <- ADS-B Receiver VCC (if 5V module)
- Arduino 3.3V <- ADS-B Receiver VCC (if 3.3V module)

OLED DISPLAY (I2C):
- Arduino SDA (Pin 20) <- OLED SDA
- Arduino SCL (Pin 21) <- OLED SCL
- Arduino 5V <- OLED VCC
- Arduino GND <- OLED GND

ANTENNA:
- 1090 MHz Antenna -> ADS-B Receiver SMA Connector

OPTIONAL COMPONENTS:

BUZZER (for audio alerts):
- Arduino Pin 8 -> Buzzer Positive
- Arduino GND -> Buzzer Negative

LED INDICATOR:
- Arduino Pin 13 -> LED Positive (with 220Î© resistor)
- Arduino GND -> LED Negative

SD CARD MODULE (for logging):
- Arduino Pin 53 -> SD Card CS
- Arduino Pin 52 -> SD Card SCK
- Arduino Pin 51 -> SD Card MOSI
- Arduino Pin 50 -> SD Card MISO
- Arduino 5V -> SD Card VCC
- Arduino GND -> SD Card GND

NOTES:
- Use high-quality jumper wires for reliable connections
- Ensure proper power supply (5V 2A minimum recommended)
- Keep antenna away from electronic interference sources
- Mount antenna outdoors or near windows for better reception
- Use breadboard for prototyping or create custom PCB for permanent setup
